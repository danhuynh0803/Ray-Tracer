# Ray-Tracer
My implementation of Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend."

# Current Progress Render: 
New functionality added: 

1) Diffuse and specular lighting with a single point light.

2) An approximation of Beer's law for dielectric materials. 

3) Soft shadows by using multiple shadow ray samples
