# Ray-Tracer
A project to be updated once I have a better understanding of physically-based lighting. 

# Current Progress Render: 
Current functionality defined: 

1) Diffuse and specular lighting with a single point light.

2) An approximation of Beer's law for dielectric materials. 

3) Soft shadows by using multiple shadow ray samples
